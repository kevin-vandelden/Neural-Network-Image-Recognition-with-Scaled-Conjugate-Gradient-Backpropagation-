# Neural-Network-Image-Recognition-with-Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient-Backpropagation-

This is a code to show the effectiveness of Scaled Conjugate Gradient Backpropogation in an image Recognition Neural Network MATLAB code.

To start, 100 photos were taken of myself wearing Nike Sunglasses, Ray Ban Wayfairs, and No Sunglasses at all. These would be the base images used in training, testing and validation in the network.

To understand how the the Images are worked into the neural network, consider the following. 

An image is composed of a matrix of pixels, where each pixel has a distinct color. Those colors may be easily described as a combination of RGB (red green blue) values that make up that specific color.

For this instance of image recognition, it is easily determined whether someone is wearing glasses without the use of color, so color information from each image can be durastically simplifed to greyscale. Where Each pixel represents an intensity scale from white to black.

Additionally, image recognition can be done with many fewer pixels, just as someone can identify images that are not extremely pixel dense. Using Greyscale, and scaled-down images for Neural Network durastically decreases the computational power required, without having adverse effects on the network accuracy.

Now that the images are in a more simple format, They must be rearranged to train on the neural network. Just as an image is a matrix of a NXM pixels of greyscale, or RGB values, that matrix can be reorganized into a 1X(MXN) Column. and this is the general input we will use for this network. In this case where each input pixel, and it's associated greyscale value, is the first "layer" of the NN
