# Neural-Network-Image-Recognition-with-Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient-Backpropagation-

This is a code to show the effectiveness of Scaled Conjugate Gradient Backpropogation in an image Recognition Neural Network MATLAB code.

To start, 100 photos were taken of myself wearing Nike Sunglasses, Ray Ban Wayfairs, and No Sunglasses at all. These would be the base images used in training, testing and validation in the network.

To understand how the the Images are worked into the neural network, consider the following. 

An image is composed of a matrix of pixels, where each pixel has a distinct color. Those Colors may be easily described as a combination of RGB (red green blue) values that make up that specific color.

For this instance of image recognition, it is easily determined whether someone is wearing glasses without the use of color, so color information from each image can be durastically simplifed to greyscale. Where Each pixel represents an intensity scale from white to black.
